# Charles Zhang

Backend engineer focused on building reliable, scalable services and clean platform foundations. I enjoy turning complex requirements into simple, well-architected systems, with strong attention to performance, security, and maintainability.

## Core stack

- **.NET**: C#, ASP.NET Core, Web API, EF Core, LINQ, Background Services, Minimal APIs  
- **Java / Spring**: Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data, Spring Security, REST APIs  
- **Node.js**: TypeScript/JavaScript, Express/NestJS-style service design, REST APIs
- **Frontend frameworks**: React, Angular, Vue
- **Go**: services/APIs, concurrency patterns, performance-oriented backend work
- **Ruby on Rails (RoR)**: Rails APIs, ActiveRecord, conventional CRUD/product backends
- **Android**: Kotlin/Java, app architecture fundamentals, API integration
- **Python / Django**: Django REST Framework-style APIs, ORM, service backends

## Tech stack & tooling

- **Architecture**: Microservices, Modular Monolith, DDD (pragmatic), Clean Architecture, Hexagonal/Ports & Adapters
- **API & Integration**: REST, OpenAPI/Swagger, gRPC, Webhooks, OAuth2/JWT
- **Web development**: HTTP/HTTPS, cookies/sessions, caching/CDN, CORS, CSRF, XSS, SSR/SPA trade-offs
- **Data**: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis; schema design, indexing, query tuning
- **Messaging**: Kafka/RabbitMQ concepts (pub/sub, retries, dead-lettering)
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Docker, CI/CD, IaC concepts; observability-first deployment mindset
- **Observability**: Structured logging, metrics, tracing, SLO-oriented monitoring
- **Quality**: Unit/integration testing, contract testing concepts, code reviews, static analysis
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS, modern JS/TS, accessibility, responsive UI, performance profiling (as needed)

## What I build

- **Service backends**: production-grade APIs, authentication/authorization, multi-tenant patterns
- **Data-heavy systems**: migrations, performance tuning, reliability under load
- **Developer-friendly platforms**: shared libraries, templates, CI/CD pipelines, internal tooling

## Engineering principles

- **Clarity over cleverness**: readable code, explicit boundaries, predictable behavior
- **Design for change**: stable interfaces, small components, incremental evolution
- **Operational excellence**: ship with logging/metrics/traces; safe rollouts and rollback paths
